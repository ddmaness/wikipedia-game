## Description

In this game created using Wikimedia's Wikipedia API, your goal is to get from the wikipedia article for the first topic to the wikipedia article for the second topic no more than 10 links. This game serves as a learning activity to help players establish mental links between seemingly disparate topics

This game was inspired by the "plot your route" game as explained in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuDLw1zIc94&t=451s) presentation by the Extra Credits YouTube channel
